# Hi, I’m Quinisha C.

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a multi-skilled Information Technology professional with a unique background bridging high-stakes physical operations and technical data management. For nearly four years, I directed large-scale property operations, managing not only the physical sites but the digital infrastructure and data integrity behind them. 

I specialize in turning "messy" operational problems into clear, workable solutions by combining technical troubleshooting with advanced data reporting. Whether I'm configuring a network or building a performance dashboard, my goal is to ensure data fidelity and system reliability for the teams I support.

What I offer:</br>
IT Infrastructure & Support: Hands-on experience with PC hardware assembly, OS configuration (Windows/macOS), and SOHO networking (TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP). 
Data-Driven Decision Making: Proficiency in SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and Python to clean, analyze, and visualize data that improves business outcomes. 
Operational Excellence: A proven track record of using internal systems and digital logs to maintain 100% record accuracy and improve service response times by 25%. 
Collaborative Communication: Extensive experience acting as a liaison between stakeholders, technical teams and non-technical end users to ensure smooth technology adoption.
 
Technical Toolkit:</br>
IT Support: PC Hardware, OS Installation, System Optimization, Basic Networking 
Data & Analytics: Advanced Excel, Tableau, SQL, Python (Pandas), Power BI 
Productivity: Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, SharePoint, Documentation/SOPs 

I'm currently expanding my technical foundation with CompTIA A+ and eager to connect with teams where my mix of operational leadership and technical curiosity can drive creativity, innovation, and positive change. Let’s collaborate!

Fun fact: I'm a cinephile and gamer with a storytelling-focused blog at https://seauxsims.tumblr.com/.

Thanks for stopping by. Let’s create something impactful together!
