# 👋 Hi, I’m Quinisha C.

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

🎯 I’m a Business Intelligence and Data Analyst passionate about using data to tell powerful stories, solve real-world problems, and uplift communities—especially within creative and mission-based spaces.

✨ I earned my Business Intelligence Analytics certification through TripleTen, where I focused on data visualization, Python scripting, SQL querying, and dashboard development using Power BI and Tableau.

🔧 Tools I use:
Power BI | Python (Pandas) | Tableau | SQL | Excel

💡 What I build:
- Analytical dashboards that reveal patterns and guide decisions
- Creative visualizations that turn numbers into stories
- Insight-driven reports for nonprofits, startups, and digital communities

🌱 I’m currently building independent projects that explore topics in equity, culture, and digital media. Every project is an opportunity to grow, reflect, and refine my skills.

💬 Let’s collaborate!
I’m open to roles and freelance projects where data meets creativity - think storytelling with impact, dashboards for community organizations, or tech for social good.
