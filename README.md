# 👋 Hi, I’m Quinisha C.

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

🎯 I’m a Business Intelligence & Data Analyst passionate about using data to tell compelling stories, solve real-world problems, and support mission-driven initiatives—particularly in creative and community-focused sectors.

✨ I earned my Business Intelligence Analytics certification through TripleTen, where I focused on data visualization, Python scripting, SQL querying, and dashboard development using Power BI and Tableau.

🔧 Tools I use:
Power BI | Python (Pandas) | Tableau | SQL | Excel

💡 What I build:
- Analytical dashboards that uncover insights and drive decisions
- Visualizations that translate complex data into clear narratives
- Insightful reports tailored for nonprofits, startups, and digital communities

🌱 I’m currently working on independent projects that explore topics in equity, culture, and digital media. Each project is an opportunity to refine my skills and contribute to meaningful work.

💬 Let’s collaborate!
I’m open to roles and freelance opportunities where data helps drive creativity, innovation, and positive change.
